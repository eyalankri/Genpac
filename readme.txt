The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a scalable,
high-throughput microservice in C#/.NET that ingests data from custom TCP streams,
handles message deduplication, and processes the data efficiently.

The primary focus for evaluation will be the architectural choices that ensure scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

The service must perform the following functions:

A. TCP Stream Ingestion:
    * Implement a server that listens on a specified TCP port.
    * The server must be able to handle multiple concurrent client connections efficiently.
    * The service should robustly handle continuous streams of binary data, including partial messages and stream synchronization.

B. Binary Protocol Parsing:
    The service receives data in a custom binary protocol format. Each message structure is as follows

    The service will receive messages over a continuous TCP stream. Each message follows this structure:

    [Sync Word] - [Device Id] - [Message Counter] - [Message Type] - [Payload Length] - [Payload]

    Sync Word - two bytes long, const 0xAA55.
    Device Id - a 4 byte long, uniq device identifier.
    Message Counter - a 2 byte long, should be incremented on every message
    Message Type - a byte marking the message type
    Payload Length - two bytes long, the rest of the message length in bytes.
    Payload - a message specific payload

    All multi-byte numeric fields (Sync Word, Payload Length, Device Id, Message Counter) are transmitted in Big Endian format

C. Message Deduplication and Validation:
    * Deduplication: If a Message Counter for a specific Device Id is received more than once, the subsequent messages with the same counter are considered duplicates and must be ignored.
    * Validation: Verify the Sync Word (0xAA55) and ensure the Payload Length matches the received data size. Invalid messages should be logged and discarded.

D. Data Processing and Routing:
    After successful ingestion, validation, and deduplication, the messages must be processed and routed based on the Message Type:
    * Device Messages (Types: 2, 11, 13): The Payload must be converted into a standardized JSON format representation of a "Device Message" and routed to a Device Message Queue.
    * Device Events (Types: 1, 3, 12, 14): The Payload should be routed directly to a Device Event Queue.

in order to Test your service there is a c# project hare named message sender be running it it should send a few tcp packets to local host on port 5000
feal free to modify it if needed

the solution should demonstrate a clean, well-structured, and easy to understand.
